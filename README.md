# Retail-Orders-Analysis-with-SQL-Python
Overview
This project demonstrates the analysis of retail orders using SQL and Python. The data is fetched from a Kaggle dataset, cleaned, transformed, and stored in a MySQL database for further analysis. SQL queries are then used to generate insights, such as the top-selling products, month-over-month sales growth, and category-wise sales analysis. The project combines Python's data processing capabilities with the power of SQL to extract meaningful business insights.
